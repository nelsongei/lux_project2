# Project 2
Predicting customers Churn is a critical task for telecom companies like Sprint, as it helps them proactively retain customers and reduce revenue loss. To create a machine learning model to predict customer churn, you can follow these steps:

1) Data Collection and Preparation: By gathering historical data on customers churn including customer profiles, usage patterns, billing information, and past churn events. Clean and preproces the collected data by handling the missing values the split the data into validation , training and test sets
2) Feature Engineering: Generate meaningful features that could impact churn, including customer demographics (age, gender, location), subscription specifics (plan type, contract duration), usage behaviors (call duration, data consumption), payment history (payment method, tardy payments), and customer interactions (support calls, complaints), with the option to leverage domain expertise for feature engineering.
3) Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): to extract insights from the data, visualize connections between variables and churn, and uncover correlations and patterns that can guide feature selection and model construction.
4) Model Selection: Opt for suitable machine learning techniques for binary classification, aimed at predicting customer churn, and explore various algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks to identify the most effective one through experimentation.
5) Data Splitting and Cross Validation: Divide the training dataset into training and validation subsets, and employ cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.
6) Model Training: Train the chosen machine learning model(s) on the training data, utilizing suitable hyperparameters, and enhance model performance by refining hyperparameters using methods like grid search or random search.
7) Model Evaluation: Assess the model(s) on the validation dataset using appropriate evaluation measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, and the confusion matrix, while prioritizing metrics that align with Sprint's business objectives, such as minimizing false negatives in churn prediction.
8) Model Interpretability: Utilize model interpretability techniques, as applicable to the chosen model, to gain insights into the most influential features for predicting churn, facilitating the development of targeted customer retention strategies.
9) Model Deployment: After training a satisfactory model, deploy it in a production environment to enable real-time predictions on incoming customer data.
10) Monitoring and Maintenance:Consistently monitor the model's performance in a production setting, regularly retraining it with new data to maintain relevance, and validate its predictions against actual churn events to uphold accuracy.
11) Actionable Insights: Translate model predictions into practical insights for Sprint's customer retention initiatives, crafting strategies to retain customers deemed high-risk by the model.
12) Feedback Loop: Set up a feedback loop to gather data regarding the efficacy of retention strategies and leverage this information for continual enhancement of the churn prediction model.
